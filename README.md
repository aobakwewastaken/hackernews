# Hackernews

I get distracted a lot at work, so it would be cool if I had a way to check what has been trending
without the distractions. So this is a way to log out all the stories/ask hn/show hn things that
have been trending throughout the day without the constant checking of the hackernews site.

## Todo

- [ ] Create a cron that runs every 3 hours
- [ ] Find logic for storing story/ask hn/show hn entities in the db
- [ ] Create email template to send a list hn links
